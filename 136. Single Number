# ===================================
#   Problem statement & information
# ===================================

# Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
# You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

# Difficulty: Easy
# Language: Python

# ===================================
#             Solution
# ===================================

# ===================================
#             Method 1
# ===================================

# Extra space O(n), complexity O(n) 
# The code creates a dictionary with the frequency for each element of nums. The value stored with the lowest frequency is then selected.

class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        index = {}
        for k, num in enumerate(nums):
            if num in index:
                index[num] += 1
            else:
                index[num] = 1
        for key, value in index.items():
            if value == 1:
                return key

# ===================================
#             Method 2
# ===================================

# Extra space O(1), complexity O(n) 
# The code takes advantage of the XOR in built function to inspect each element of nums and return the only value with the lowest frequency.

class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        prov = 0
        for num in nums:
            prov ^= num
        return prov
